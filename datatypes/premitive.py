types of conversion or casting'''
 '''a.int '''
        # a="10"
        #     print(type(a))
        #     a=int(a)
        #      print(type(a))

 '''b.float: in float number we use 0 at the first ie 05.ff'''
    # a=6.776
    # print(type(a))  
    
    
 '''c.complex: there are two types of number real and imaginary number'''
    # eg. a=5+6j
    # print(a.real)
    # print(a.imag)

'''2.string: sequence of character '''
     #eg. _name_="Deepak "
     #print(_name_)
     #print(_name_[5])  object slicing in every letter 0= d, 1=e, 2=e, 3=p, ....

      #print(about[:]) : that means start from first and end at last samma ko value represent garxa
      #print(about[3:9]) start from 'portfo' and answer is also this
      # print(about.upper())
      # print(about.lower())
      # print(about.capitalize()) #first letter is capital letter and other all are lower
